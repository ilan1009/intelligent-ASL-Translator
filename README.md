# intelligent-ASL-Translator

Normal sign language translators just give you a list of letters.
This one actually finds words for reliable sources and creates a video showing you how to say anything you'd like.

use _ to have multiple words translate together example: no_way >> "no way", but "no way" >> "no", "way"
to be added:
- failsafe for when word isnt found, list the individual letters. (currently ignores word and moves to the next one) (DONE)

- gui?
- progress bar (DONE)
- headless mode, doesnt work with it currently.

- add to my own personal site, never used python backend before though.
